sysutils/pcmanfm-qt: update  to 1.3.0

pcmanfm-qt-1.3.0 / 2023-04-15
==============================
 * Don't try to activate windows under Wayland (it isn't possible).
 * Leave the pixmap cache limit to Qt (and avoid extra CPU usage is rare cases).
 * Added a title for Desktop (for setting WM rules under some Wayland
   compositors).
 * Localize tab texts for special folders ("search", Applications, Computer,
   Network, Trash and Desktop).
 * Prevent Desktop items from shaking on config changes.
 * Remove Desktop's drop indicator on leaving Desktop.
 * Keep dragged and dropped items together on Desktop as far as possible.
