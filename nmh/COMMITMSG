nmh: Update to 1.8

Changes:
===
1.8
===
Welcome to nmh, the new version of the classic MH mail handling system.
It's been nearly five years since the last release of nmh, and there have
been a number of significant changes since that last release.  Long-time
MH and nmh users should read carefully the NOTABLE CHANGES section, as
there are some significant changes to nmh behavior.  Otherwise, please
see the README and INSTALL files for help on getting started with nmh.

This release is dedicated to Norman Z. Shapiro, co-designer of the MH
Message Handling System.  MH is the predecessor of nmh.  Norm was an
active supporter of nmh development until he passed away in October of
2021.  We are most grateful to Norm for his stewardship of MH and nmh.

---------------
NOTABLE CHANGES
---------------

- Support for Content-MD5 header fields, MIME content cache functionality,
  and the message/partial MIME type have been removed.
- Gmail OAuth2/XOAUTH support for desktop applications has been effectively
  dropped, so nmh no longer supports it.  nmh support for Gmail API access
  is experimental, please post to nmh-workers@nongnu.org if you'd like to
  help with test and development.
- repl(1) -convertargs now allows editing of the composition draft between
  translation and any encoding of text content.  Because encoding can wrap
  long lines, the use of a paragraph formatter has been removed from
  mhn.defaults.

------------
NEW FEATURES
------------

- The default editor has been changed from 'vi' to 'prompter', to align with
  historical practice and reduce packaging dependencies on external programs.
- A new -checkbase64 switch has been added to mhfixmsg(1).
- inc(1)/msgchk(1) now support STARTTLS for the POP protocol.
- All TLS-supported protocols now will send the SNI (server name indicator)
  TLS extension.
- A new mh-format function %(ordinal) has been implemented to output the
  appropriate ordinal suffix for numbers.  Example: "%(num 22)%(ordinal)"
  will output "22nd".
- show and mhl now decode more addresses in header fields.
- Added warning from all programs that read the profile if the profile
  contains a post entry, which is ignored, but does not contain a
  postproc entry.  In other words, if you get this warning and want
  to suppress it, your options include:
  1) Remove your post profile entry.
  2) Make your post profile entry a comment by prepending it with the #:
     comment indicator.
  3) Add a postproc entry that points to the post that you use.  That can
     be viewed with "mhparam postproc".
- scan(1) -file argument can be a Maildir directory.
- Updated mhn.defaults to prefer mpv(1) over xv(1) and replace mpeg_play(1),
  and to use it for all video types, not just video/mpeg.  And prefer all
  other searched-for pdf viewers over acroread(1).
- Added mhshow-suffix-video.mp4 to mhn.defaults, for use by mhshow(1) and
  send(1).
- Removed support from mhn.defaults for application/x-ivs and text/richtext.
- Changed interpretation of argument to mhfixmsg(1) -decodeheaderfieldbodies
  switch to specify character set of the decoded field bodies.
- repl(1) -convertargs now allows editing of the composition draft between
  translation and any encoding of text content.
- install-mh(1) now enables the mh-draft(5) draft folder facility.

-----------------
OBSOLETE FEATURES
-----------------

- The generation and verification of a Content-MD5 field has been removed
  without deprecation.  The related -check and -nocheck options now error.
- The MIME content cache functionality has been mostly non-functional since
  the development on nmh, and consequently all of the content caching code
  and related switches (-cache/-rcache/-wcache) have been removed.
- Support for generating and reassembling message/partial messages has been
  removed; it seems that this has been broken since 1.5 and there is very
  little support across MUAs.
- Marked Gmail OAuth2/XOAUTH support as being unsupported.
- Support for the MHPDEBUG environment variable was removed.  It was
  deprecated in nmh 1.7.  The pick(1) -debug switch replaced it.
- The 'libdir' mhparam(1) component was removed.  It was deprecated in
  nmh 1.7, when it was replaced by a new 'libexecdir' component.

---------
BUG FIXES
---------

- Fixed bcc to work with sendmail/pipe, and better documented that dcc
  doesn't work with it [Bug 55700].
- An -attendee switch has been added to mhical(1), for use when more than one
  (or zero) attendees match a user's mailbox.
- Fixed inc(1) and %(me) function escape to not obey Local-Mailbox profile
  component.
- Fixed source charset in mhfixmsg textcharset verbose output.
- Fixed mhfixmsg charset determination of content added with -reformat.
- Fixed file descriptor leak in mhfixmsg when run on multiple input files.
- Fixed mhfixmsg(1) -decodeheaderfilebodies to support mixed encoded/undecoded.
- Fixed memory corruption in post(1) and inc(1) when using XOAUTH2,
  with 4 or more entries in the oauth-authservice file.
- Added alias expansion to From: address for use by sendfrom.
- Removed extra space added before header field bodies by dist(1) to $mhdraft.
- Fixed display of iCalendar object with multiple VEVENTS using a VTIMEZONE.
- Fixed allowable encodings with MIME message types to get closer to RFC 2046.
- Detect other files regardless of backup prefix [Bug #49476].
- Copy if hard link by refile(1) or send(1) fails with EACESS [Bug 56575].
