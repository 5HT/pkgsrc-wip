Open source codebase of the game Overgrowth by Wolfire Games LLC.

Feel like the star of a martial arts film in Overgrowth, as you jump, kick,
throw, and slash your way to victory. Free the rabbits from their evil
overlords in the main story, then play through the prequel story, and
finally, try out nine years of mods on the Steam Workshop!

Overgrowth is the spiritual successor to Lugaru.
