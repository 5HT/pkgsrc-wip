-  The bin/ directory should not have subdirectories.
   A possible workaround would be to install bin/mh/* executables in
   ${PREFIX}/mh/bin and symlink the folder to ${PREFIX}/bin. 

- Patch for libwrap missing `allow_severity', `deny_severity' ints. 
  This would fix building with TCP wrappers. Include <tcpd.h> where
  needed.

- Add options.mk to handle: 
* Python/C++/Guile parsing (disabled by default). I would have included
  C++ support, but it's marked as experimental in more recent versions. 
* GnuTLS/SASL (enabled by default). Currently disabled in the Makefile.
* GDBM (disabled by default)
* LDAP (disabled by default)
* NLS (disabled by default). Probably requires a PLIST.NLS.
