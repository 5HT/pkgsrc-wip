- Add basic python packaging.

- Add dependencies for XMPP.

- Think about other dependencies, at least for those of manageable
  size which enable notification to open protocols

- Think about dependencies for proprietary protcols.  With any luck,
  there is simply a requirement to install some python for runtime and
  there is no need to have it be part of the package.
