Update tcl-expect to expect5.45.4 from expect5.45.0

Expect is a tool for automating interactive applications such as telnet, ftp, passwd, 
fsck, rlogin, tip, etc. Expect really makes this stuff trivial. Expect is also useful 
for testing these same applications.

See: https://core.tcl-lang.org/expect/index

Note: Many of the links on the above do not work.

There is a bug tracker:

    https://core.tcl-lang.org/expect/rptview?rn=1

Emails were sent to them but on notes were added to the bug tracking system, no 
activity on fixing bugs is reported since the release.

patch-Makefile.in from expect5.45.0 needed to be modified to define a @SHLIB_VERSION@.

Rather than teaching PLIST about .@SHLIB_VERSION@ in which many said "felt wrong"
a patch-Makefile.in has .1.0 hard-coded instead of the previous .@SHLIB_VERSION@.

In patch-configure:

We are patching configure and not generarting it.

The patches to add MirBSD and DragonFly are not in upstream.  They don't appear 
to have not been applied upstream...

patch-tclconfig_tcl.m4

Added support for UnixWare/svr5 to tclconfig/tcl.m4

SCO OpenServer 5 needs linking done with gcc, gcc is use to link because there is 
no gnu ld.  The native compiler uses ld which comes with OS and doesn't work with
gcc.
   
patch-retoglob.c

SVR5/UnixWare has a name space clash
