lang/tcl-expect:  Update to 5.45.4

Packaging changes:

Adapt patch to add SHLIB_VERSION to config.status across autoconf
versions; the autoconf version used in 5.45.4 is more declarative.

Add patch to tclconfig/tcl.m4 for UnixWare/SVR5.  \todo Explain how
this is effective if configure is not regenerated.

2018-02-04  Nils Carlson <nils.carlson@ludd.ltu.se>

	* exp_inter.c: [https://sourceforge.net/p/expect/patches/22/]
	Fix interact bug - handle reads of 0 length on
	non-blocking channels by explicitly checking if the channel
	is non-blocking. Fix by Jack Bates.

	* expect.c: [https://sourceforge.net/p/expect/patches/21/]
	Fix eof bug introduced with previous bug fix - ensure that data
	received just before an eof is processed. Fix by Sergei Golovan.

2014-05-01  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* expect.c [http://sourceforge.net/p/expect/bugs/76/]. Report and
	  fix by Mutsuhito Iikura. On finding a full buffer during
	  matching the sliding window mechanism slides too far, truncating
	  the whole buffer and preventing matches across the boundary. Fix
	  is shortening the slide distance (slide only one 1/3).

	* expect.c: [http://sourceforge.net/p/expect/patches/18/]. Report
	  and fix both by Nils Carlson <nils.carlson@ludd.ltu.se>.
	  Replaced a cc==0 check with proper Tcl_Eof() check.

2013-11-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* expect.c: [http://sourceforge.net/p/expect/patches/16/]. Report
	  and fix both by Per Cederqvist. Replaced a memcpy with memmove
	  as the latter properly handles overlapping memory, whereas the
	  original code does not.

2012-08-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* exp_chan.c: Applied patch sent in by Ogawa Hirofumi
	  <hirofumi@mail.parknet.co.jp>. The patch fixes a problem when
	  talking a tty where the writer has died. Some operating systems
	  report the condition as EIO with nothing read, while this
	  actually an EOF. Without the patch the returned data is
	  incomplete due to the error reported immediately and dropping
	  data in buffers.

2012-05-16  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* exp_chan.c: [Bug 3526461]: Applied patch by Michael Cleverly
	  <cleverly@users.sourceforge.net> fixing a problem with the
	  iteration over the expect channel list where the loop code may
	  modify the list, breaking the iterator.

	* exp_chan.c: [Bug 3526707]: Applied patch by Michael Cleverly
	* exp_command.h: <cleverly@users.sourceforge.net> fixing problem
	* expect.c: with an insufficient test for a lost channel in
	  exp_background_channelhandler.
