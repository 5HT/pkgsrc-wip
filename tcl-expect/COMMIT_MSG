Upstream used to export SHLIB_VERSION from configure into
config.status, and thus it was usable in our patched Makefile so that
the install rules would work if SHLIB_VERSION changed.  Instead,
\todo.
  Rather than teaching PLIST about .@SHLIB_VERSION@ in which many said "felt wrong"
  a patch-Makefile.in has .1.0 hard-coded instead of the previous .@SHLIB_VERSION@.

Add patch to tclconfig/tcl.m4 for UnixWare/SVR5.  \todo Explain how
this is effective if configure is not regenerated.
