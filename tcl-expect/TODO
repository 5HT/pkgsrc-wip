- Explain why patch-Makefile.in has .1.0 hard-coded instead of the
  previous .@SHLIB_VERSION@.

- In patch-configure:

   - Remove comments 'taken from previous'; the expectation is that
     all content from the pkgsrc package is in the new version, absent
     a good reason and documented in COMMIT_MSG.

   - Explain "avoid regenerating within pkgsrc", which is labeled as
     from the previous version but does not appear there.  Plus, it is
     tagged as an ERROR by pkglint.

- In patch-tclconfig_tcl.m4

   - Move explanations of changes to COMMIT_MSG rather than adding
     comments to the file being patched.

   - Improve patch comment; the change to SVR3.2 linking is not explained.
   
- The package patches an m4 file and configure, and this doesn't
  really make sense, as either we are regenerating configure or we
  aren't.  At the momennt we are not regenerating configure, so the m4
  patch has no effect.  Explain/fix.
