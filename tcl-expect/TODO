- In patch-configure:

   - Check "avoid regenerating within pkgsrc", which is labeled as
     from the previous version but does not appear there.  This is no
     longer present, but if someone thinks it belongs we should
     discuss.

- The package patches an m4 file and configure, and this doesn't
  really make sense, as either we are regenerating configure or we
  aren't.  At the moment we are not regenerating configure, so the m4
  patch has no effect.  Explain/fix.
