- Create COMMIT_MSG for use in updating pkgsrc

- Resolve "lib/libexpect5454.so.@SHLIB_VERSION@" in PLIST.  Somehow in
  DESTDIR there is libexpect5454.so.@SHLIB_VERSION@ and that seems
  like an error that should be fixed, rather than teaching PLIST about
  the error.

- In patch-configure, somehow make it comprehensible what has changed
  vs what is in pkgsrc.

- In patch-tclconfig_tcl.m4, explain migration of things from pkgsrc
  patch-configure.  Or perhaps don't migrate.

- For things mailed upstream in 2019, one would expect they've been
  applied and are in a new release.  Explain somehow what's going on.
  It sort of seems like "This program is not maintained upstream."

- Consider patching configure.ac and regenerating instead of
  configure.
