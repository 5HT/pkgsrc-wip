- Create COMMIT_MSG for use in updating pkgsrc.  Most of the
  explanations below belong here, besides the usual upstream NEWS.

- Explain why patch-Makefile.in has .1.0 hard-coded instead of the
  previous .@SHLIB_VERSION@.

- In patch-configure:

   - Explain why the patches to add MirBSD and DragonFly were dropped;
     they don't appear to have been applied upstream.

   - Remove comments 'taken from previous'; the expectation is that
     all content from the pkgsrc package is in the new version, absent
     a good reason and documented in COMMIT_MSG.

   - Explain why subsituting @SHLIB_VERSION@ is added.

   - Explain "avoid regenerating within pkgsrc", which is labeled as
     from the previous version but does not appear there.  Plus, it is
     tagged as an ERROR by pkglint.

- In patch-tclconfig_tcl.m4

   - Move explanations of changes to COMMIT_MSG rather than adding
     comments to the file being patched.

   - Improve patch comment; the change to SVR3.2 linking is not explained.
   

- In patch-exp__chan.c, explain why it is dropped.

- The package patches an m4 file and configure, and this doesn't
  really make sense, as either we are regenerating configure or we
  aren't.  Explain/fix.
