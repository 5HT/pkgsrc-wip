As of 3.0.0, Radicale no longer provides a daemonize function, instead
relying on the service manager. Currently handling backgrounding the
process with nohup.

Since all log data is output to stderr, the rc.d script will need to
manage storing that. Not sure if the best method of handling this is by
dumping stderr to @VARBASE@/log, or to use something like logger(1).
