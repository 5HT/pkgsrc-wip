---- CD1C04D CHECK THAT AN ENUMERATION REPRESENTATION CLAUSE CAN BE
                GIVEN FOR A DERIVED ENUMERATION TYPE EVEN IF THE
                REPRESENTATION IS INHERITED FROM THE PARENT, AND THAT
                THE CLAUSE FOR THE DERIVED TYPE OVERRIDES THAT OF THE
                PARENT.
