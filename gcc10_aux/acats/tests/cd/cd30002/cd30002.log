---- CD30002 Check that the implementation supports Alignments for
                subtypes and objects specified as factors and multiples 
                of the number of storage elements per word, unless those
                values cannot be loaded and stored. Check that the
                largest alignment returned by default is supported.
                Check that the implementation supports Alignments
                supported by the target linker for stand-alone
                library-level objects of statically constrained
                subtypes.
