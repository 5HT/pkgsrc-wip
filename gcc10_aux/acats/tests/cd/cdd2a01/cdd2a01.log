---- CDD2A01 Check that the Read and Write attributes for a type
                extension are created from the parent type's attribute
                (which may be user-defined) and those for the extension 
                components; also check that the default input and output
                attributes are used for a type extension, even if the
                parent type's attribute is user-defined.
