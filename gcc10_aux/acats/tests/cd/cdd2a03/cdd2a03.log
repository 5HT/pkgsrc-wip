---- CDD2A03 Check that the default Read and Write attributes for a
                limited type extension are created from the parent
                type's attribute (which may be user-defined) and those
                for the extension components, if the extension
                components are non-limited or have user-defined
                attributes; check that such limited type extension
                attributes are callable.
