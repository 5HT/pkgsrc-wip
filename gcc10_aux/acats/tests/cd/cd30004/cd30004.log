---- CD30004 Check that the unspecified Size of static discrete and
                fixed point subtypes is the number of bits needed to
                represent each value belonging to the subtype using an
                unbiased representation, where space for a sign bit is
                provided only in the event the subtype contains negative
                values.  Check that for first subtypes specified Sizes
                are supported reflecting this representation..
