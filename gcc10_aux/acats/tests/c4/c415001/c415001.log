---- C415001 Check that the reference_object_name is evaluated by the
                evaluation of a generalized reference and that
                Constraint_Error is raised by a generalized reference
                whose value is null. Check that a generalized reference 
                denotes the object denoted by the value of the reference
                discriminant. Check that the object designated by a
                generalized reference can be modified if the
                discriminant has an access-to-variable type.
