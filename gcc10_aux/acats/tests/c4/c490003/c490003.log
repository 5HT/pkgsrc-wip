---- C490003 Check that static expressions failing Overflow_Check are
                legal if part of a larger static expression. Check that 
                static expressions as right operands of short-circuit
                control forms are not evaluated if value of control form
                is determined by left operand. Check that static
                expressions in non-static contexts are evaluated
                exactly.
