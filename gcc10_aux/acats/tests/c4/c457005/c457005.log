---- C457005 When the selecting expression of a case expression is a
                name with a static nominal subtype and has a static
                predicate, the static predicate is disabled, and the
                value of the selecting expression does not satisfy the
                predicate, check that the others choice is returned, or,
                if there is no others choice, that Constraint_Error is
                raised.
   - C457005 Case expression raised Constraint_Error as expected -
                Even_Var_1.
   - C457005 Case expression raised Constraint_Error as expected -
                Prime_Var.
   - C457005 Case expression raised Constraint_Error as expected - X1.
