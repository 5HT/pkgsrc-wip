---- C456001 For exponentiation of floating point types, check that
                Constraint_Error is raised (or, if if no exception is
                raised and Machine_Overflows is False, that a result is 
                produced) if the result is outside of the range of the
                base type..
   - C456001 Constraint_Error was not raised for exponentiation and
                Machine_Overflows is False.
