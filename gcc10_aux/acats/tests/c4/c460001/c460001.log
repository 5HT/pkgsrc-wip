---- C460001 Check that if the target type of a type conversion is a
                general access type, Program_Error is raised if the
                accessibility level of the operand type is deeper than
                that of the target type: operand is an access parameter;
                corresponding actual is an allocator, expression of a
                named access type, Obj'Access.
