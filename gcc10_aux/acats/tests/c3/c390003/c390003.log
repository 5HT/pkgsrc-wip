---- C390003 Check that for a subtype S of a tagged type T, S'Class
                denotes a class-wide subtype.  Check that T'Tag denotes 
                the tag of the type T, and that, for a class-wide tagged
                type X, X'Tag denotes the tag of X.  Check that the tags
                of stand alone objects, record and array components,
                aggregates, and formal parameters identify their type.
                Check that the tag of a value of a formal parameter is
                that of the actual parameter, even if the actual is
                passed by a view conversion.
