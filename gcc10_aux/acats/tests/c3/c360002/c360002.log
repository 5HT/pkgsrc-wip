---- C360002 Check that modular types may be used as array indices. 
                Check that if aliased appears in the
                component_definition of an array_type that each
                component of the array is aliased.  Check that
                references to aliased array objects produce correct
                results, and that out of bound references to aliased
                objects correctly produce Constraint_Error.
