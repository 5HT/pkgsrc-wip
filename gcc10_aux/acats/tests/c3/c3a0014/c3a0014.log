---- C3A0014 Check that if the view defined by an object declaration is 
                aliased, has discriminants, and its nominal subtype is
                unconstrained, then the object is unconstrained. Check
                that the attribute A'Constrained returns False if A is a
                formal out or in out parameter and A denotes an aliased 
                view of an object with an unconstrained nominal
                subtype..
