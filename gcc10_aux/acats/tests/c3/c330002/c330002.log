---- C330002 Check that if a subtype indication of a variable object
                defines an indefinite subtype, then there is an
                initialization expression.  Check that the object
                remains so constrained throughout its lifetime.  Check
                that Constraint_Error is raised if an attempt is made to
                change bounds as well as discriminants of the objects of
                the indefinite subtypes.  Check for cases of tagged
                record and generic formal types.
