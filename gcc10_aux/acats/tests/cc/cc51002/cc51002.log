---- CC51002 Check that, for formal derived tagged types, the formal
                parameter names and default expressions for a primitive 
                subprogram in an instance are determined by the
                primitive subprogram of the ancestor type, but that the 
                primitive subprogram body executed is that of theactual 
                type.
