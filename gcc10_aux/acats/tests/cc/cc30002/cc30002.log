---- CC30002 Check that an explicit declaration in the private part of
                an instance does not override an implicit declaration in
                the instance, unless the corresponding explicit
                declaration in the generic overrides a corresponding
                implicit declaration in the generic. Check for primitive
                subprograms of tagged types.
