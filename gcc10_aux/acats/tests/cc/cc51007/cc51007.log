---- CC51007 Check that, for a generic formal derived type whose
                ancestor type has abstract primitive subprograms,
                neither the formal derived type nor its descendants need
                be abstract, and that objects of, components of,
                allocators of, aggregates of, and nonabstract functions 
                returning these types are legal. Check that calls to the
                abstract primitive subprograms of the ancestor dispatch 
                to the bodies corresponding to the tag of the actual
                parameters.
