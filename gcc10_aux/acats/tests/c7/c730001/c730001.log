---- C730001 Check that the full view of a private extension may be
                derived indirectly from the ancestor type. Check that,
                for a primitive subprogram of the private extension that
                is inherited from the ancestor type and not overridden, 
                the formal parameter names and default expressions come 
                from the corresponding primitive subprogram of the
                ancestor type, while the body comes from that of the
                parent type.
