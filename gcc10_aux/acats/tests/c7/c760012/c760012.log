---- C760012 Check that record components that have per-object access
                discriminant constraints are initialized in the order of
                their component declarations, and after any components
                that are not so constrained.  Check that record
                components that have per-object access discriminant
                constraints are finalized in the reverse order of their 
                component declarations, and before any components that
                are not so constrained.
