---- C760009 Check that for an extension_aggregate whose ancestor_part
                is a subtype_mark, Initialize is called on all
                controlled subcomponents of the ancestor part.  Also
                check that the utilization of a controlled type for a
                generic actual parameter supports the correct behavior
                in the instantiated software.
