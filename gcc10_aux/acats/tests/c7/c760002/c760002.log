---- C760002 Check that assignment causes the Adjust operation of the
                type to be called.  Check that Adjust is called after
                copying the value of the source expression to the target
                object.  Check that Adjust is called for all controlled 
                components when the containing object is assigned. 
                Check that Adjust is called for components before the
                containing object is adjusted.  Check that Adjust is not
                called for a Limited_Controlled type by the
                implementation.
