This is github based version of devel/buddy. The latter is sourceforge based.
Unfortunately the relase 2.4 from both these sources are out of sync. github
based release (this) is newer and contains the .pc file required for dependent
packages like ltsmin to build.

THIS PACKAGE SHOULD BE REMOVED ONCE devel/buddy ADOPTS github BASED ONE.
