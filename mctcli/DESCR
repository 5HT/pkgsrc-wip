MCTcli is a simple tool inspired by MIFARE Classic Tool on Android but in
command-line (and written in C).
It's a tool to try to access the content of a MIFARE Classic tag (1K/S50 or
4K/S70) using libfreefare, libNFC and a device supported by libNFC (tested
with ACR122U, ASK/LoGO, SCL3711 and PN532-over-USBserial).
