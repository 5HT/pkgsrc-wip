Jibri provides services for recording or streaming a Jitsi Meet conference.

It works by launching a Chrome instance rendered in a virtual framebuffer and
capturing and encoding the output with ffmpeg. It is intended to be run on a
separate machine (or a VM), with no other applications using the display or
audio devices. Only one recording at a time is supported on a single jibri.
