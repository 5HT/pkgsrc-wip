- `podman machine init' does not seem to work - or at least do not create the
  `.ign' file that can be overwritten/adjusted in order to be able to customize
  kernel boot arguments. This is probably due
  <https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11824> and can be workarounded
  by passing arguments to `machine init', the defaults are:

   % podman machine init --cpus 1 --memory 2048 --disk-size 10
