This project is a re-implementation of the game Duke Nukem II,
originally released by Apogee Software in 1993. RigelEngine works
as a drop-in replacement for the original executable: It reads the
original data files and offers the same experience (plus some
improvements), but runs natively on modern operating systems, and
is written in modern C++ code with a completely new architecture
under the hood.
