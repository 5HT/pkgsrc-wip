openage is a free (as in freedom) cross-platform RTS game engine that
provides the mechanics of Age of Empires.

Using modern technologies as C++17, OpenGL/GLSL, Python, Qt5 and CMake
allows people using GNU/Linux, BSD, macOS or Windows to play the game
natively.

Our aim is to make openage a platform for the original Age of Empires games
providing the same look and feel, but with more features for modding and
multiplayer.
