Part 24: Middle-texture rendering
=================================
[X] Some middle-textures are rendered wrong in Pagodia
    => Reported upstream in ticket #687
    => Fixed with SVN revision 1647


Part 25: Add UMAPINFO support
=============================
[ ] Based on libdoom-umapinfo
    => Module to parse and import data added
    => Hooked in keys 'label', "levelname', 'next' and 'nextsecret'
       The default prefix for 'levelname' does not work yet
