reviewdog provides a way to post review comments to code hosting
service, such as GitHub, automatically by integrating with any linter
tools with ease. It uses an output of lint tools and posts them as a
comment if findings are in diff of patches to review.

reviewdog also supports run in the local environment to filter an
output of lint tools by diff.
