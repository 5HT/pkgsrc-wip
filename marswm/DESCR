marswm aims to be the rusty successor to moonwm, https://github.com/jzbor/moonwm
In addition to the window manager this repository also contains the library,
libmars it is built on, an accompanying status bar, marsbar and an ipc client,
mars-relay to control the window manager from external scripts.

Features:
- dwm-style layouts
- workspaces (like i3 - unlike dwm)
- IPC using X11 atoms (`mars-relay`)
- YAML for configuration and key bindings
