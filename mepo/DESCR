Mepo is a fast, simple, and hackable OSM map viewer for desktop linux
& mobile linux devices (like the Pinephone, Librem 5 etc.) and both
environment's various user interfaces (Wayland & X inclusive). Mepo
works both offline and online, features a minimalist both touch/mouse
and keyboard compatible interface, and offers a UNIX-philosophy inspired
underlying design, exposing a powerful command language called mepolang
capable of being scripted to provide things like custom bounding-box
search scripts, bookmarks, and more.
