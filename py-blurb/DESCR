blurb is a tool designed to rid CPython core development of the
scourge of Misc/NEWS conflicts.

The core concept: split Misc/NEWS into many separate files that,
when concatenated back together in sorted order, reconstitute the
original Misc/NEWS file. After that, Misc/NEWS could be deleted
from the CPython repo and thereafter rendered on demand (e.g. when
building a release). When checking in a change to CPython, the
checkin process will write out a new file that sorts into the
correct place, using a filename unlikely to have a merge conflict.

blurb is a single command with a number of subcommands. It's designed
to be run inside a valid CPython (git) repo, and automatically uses
the correct file paths.
