- Seems to be unable to communicate with libvirtd via socket.
  (Maybe take a look at systemd scripts for comparison)

- Builds backends depending on availability, e.g. on a Debian machine
  with ZFS installed libvirt_storage_backend_zfs.la will be built, but
  on a fresh install it will not. These things should probably be made
  explicit with configure flags, possibily supporting options.mk.

- Some files from PLIST missing on macOS.

- _PATH_MOUNTED undefined in storage/storage_backend_fs.c with
  musl-libc.
