- Seems to be unable to communicate with libvirtd via socket.
  (Maybe take a look at systemd scripts for comparison)

- Builds backends depending on availability, e.g. on a Debian machine
  with ZFS installed libvirt_storage_backend_zfs.la will be built, but
  on a fresh install it will not. These things should probably be made
  explicit with configure flags, possibily supporting options.mk.

- On CentOS 8 and Void Linux (with musl-libc): "configure: error: Cannot
  find a XDR library". This can be installed with the system package
  manager but there's also a portablexdr package we could use, perhaps
  with a builtin.mk.
