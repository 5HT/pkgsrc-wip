filesystems/tahoe-lafs: Update to 1.16.0

The previous stable release of Tahoe-LAFS was v1.15.1, released on
March 23rd, 2021.

The major change in this release is the completion of the Python 3
port -- while maintaining support for Python 2. A future release will
remove Python 2 support.

The previously deprecated subcommands "start", "stop", "restart" and
"daemonize" have been removed. You must now use "tahoe run" (possibly
along with your favourite daemonization software).

Several features are now removed: the Account Server, stats-gatherer
and FTP support.

There are several dependency changes that will be interesting for
distribution maintainers.

In all, 240 issues have been fixed since the last release.

Please see ``NEWS.rst`` for a more complete list of changes.


Previous to 1.16, but new to pkgsrc in this update:

  Magic Folder has been removed to a separate project.
