v6.2.0
======

Overview

The primary purpose of this release is to restore --tsvlite which, by its own, would merit a 6.1.1 bugfix release. But since a
couple other new features are present as well, this is a 6.2.0 minor release.

All the "Plans for 6.2.0" listed at https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/releases/tag/v6.1.0 are all still in-plan, but since this
6.2.0 exists sooner than later, those issues are planned for a 6.3.0.

  * Let dhms2sec accept input like "8h" by @johnkerl in #983

  * Bump github.com/stretchr/testify from 1.7.0 to 1.7.1 by @dependabot in #986

v6.0.0
======

This is a significant release with many improvements to user experience, documentation, and performance.

Please see What's new in Miller 6 for complete information.

https://miller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/new-in-miller-6

v5.10.3
=======

This release exists solely to resolve a Conda-build issue as discussed on #740. If you're not actively working on Conda packaging
for Miller, this release has no added value for you above 5.10.2.

Likewise, there's no Windows mlr.exe for this final (technical & specific) Miller 5.x release -- for Miller 6.0.0 (coming soon!)
and above there will be mlr.exe as a reliably standard part of each release.

Also note that the tarball is named miller-5.10.3.tar.gz, in contrast to mlr-5.10.2.tar.gz and likewise for all earlier releases.
This is being done for forward compatibility with Miller 6.0.0 and beyond which will use names of the form miller-6.0.0.tar.gz, as
proposed in #360.
