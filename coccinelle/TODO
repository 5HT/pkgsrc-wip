Still not ready for using it to update devel/coccinelle. The following issues
should be investigated further and if possible fixed:

 - Update to coccinelle-1.0.8 breaks textproc/coccigrep, e.g.:

    % cd pkgsrc/pkgtools/pkg_install/files/admin
    % coccigrep -t size_t *.c

   does not print anything (while there are several variables of size_t type).

 - When built with PYTHON_VERSION_DEFAULT=38, test fails with:

    bc_1.res

   When built with PYTHON_VERSION_DEFAULT=27, the test score on NetBSD/amd64
   -current are:

    total score
    --------------------------------
    good = 241/554
    Current score is greater than expected :)
    (was expecting 0 but got 241)
