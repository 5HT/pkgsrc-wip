Kivaloo (pronounced "kee-va-lieu") is a collection of utilities
which together form a data store associating keys of up to 255
bytes with values of up to 255 bytes. It was designed to satisfy
the needs of the Tarsnap online backup service for high-performance
key-value storage.

At present, kivaloo comprises a block store (lbs) providing
log-structured storage within a local filesystem; a key-value store
(kvlds) which manages a log-structured B+Tree and services requests
upon it from a single connection; and a request multiplexer (mux)
which accepts multiple connections and routes requests and responses
to and from a single "upstream" connection.
