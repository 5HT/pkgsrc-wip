SIP - A Python Bindings Generator for C and C++ Libraries
=========================================================

What is SIP?
------------

One of the features of Python that makes it so powerful is the ability to take
existing libraries, written in C or C++, and make them available as Python
extension modules.  Such extension modules are often called bindings for the
library.

SIP is a collection of tools that makes it very easy to create Python bindings
for C and C++ libraries.  It was originally developed in 1998 to create PyQt,
the Python bindings for the Qt toolkit, but can be used to create bindings for
any C or C++ library.  For example it is also used to generate wxPython, the
Python bindings for wxWidgets.

SIP comprises a set of build tools and a sip module. The build tools process a
set of specification files and generates C or C++ code which is then compiled
to create the bindings extension module.  Several extension modules may be
