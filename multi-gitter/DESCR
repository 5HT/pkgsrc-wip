multi-gitter allows you to make changes in multiple repositories
simultaneously. This is achieved by running a script or program in the
context of multiple repositories. If any changes are made, a pull
request is created that can be merged manually by the set reviewers, or
automatically by multi-gitter when CI pipelines has completed
successfully.
