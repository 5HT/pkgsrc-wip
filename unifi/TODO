* Update to 7.0.20, but note that it is a release candidate, not a
  release, and thus we need to wait for release status in addition to
  testing before promotion to pkgsrc.

* Test with RELRO

* Figure out openjdk11.

* Consider adding mongo 3.6, which is the documented version.  It
  would be good to understand Ubiqitui's plans before doing this.
