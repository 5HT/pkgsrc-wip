devel/efivar: Add efivar 38

This is an adaptation of https://github.com/rhboot/efivar to make it
work on BSD systems.  Amount of changes is quite substantial and is
very similar across *BSD systems, so a fork is used instead of a set of
patches (there are still small patches in the port related to building
on NetBSD).

Fully implementing libefiboot for a system will take a lot of work, so
it has limitations [1].  Generating abbreviated device paths works and
that's enough to boot an EFI payload, making it useful for fwupd.
