An open source re-implementation of Caesar III
The aim of this project is to create an open-source
version of Caesar 3, with the same logic as the original,
but with some UI enhancements, that is able to be played
on multiple platforms.
The same logic means that the saved games are 100% compatible,
and any gameplay bugs present in the original Caesar 3 game
will also be present in Julius.
Run Julius with the path where the original Caesar3 data
directory is extracted :
$ julius path-to-c3-directory
