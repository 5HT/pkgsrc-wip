MySQL++ is a C++ wrapper for the MySQL and MariaDB C APIs.  It is built
on the same principles as the Standard C++ Library to make dealing with
the database as easy as dealing with `std` containers. MySQL++ also
provides facilities that let you avoid the most repetitive sorts of SQL
within your own code, providing native C++ interfaces for these common
tasks.
