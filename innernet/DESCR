innernet is a private network system that uses WireGuard under the hood.

innernet is similar in its goals to Slack's nebula or Tailscale, but takes a
bit of a different approach. It aims to take advantage of existing networking
concepts like CIDRs and the security properties of WireGuard to turn your
computer's basic IP networking into more powerful ACL primitives.

innernet is not an official WireGuard project, and WireGuard is a registered
trademark of Jason A. Donenfeld.

This has not received an independent security audit, and should be considered
experimental software at this early point in its lifetime.
