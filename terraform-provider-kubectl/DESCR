This provider is the best way of managing Kubernetes resources in
Terraform, by allowing you to use the thing Kubernetes loves best -
YAML!

This core of this provider is the kubectl_manifest resource, allowing
free-form YAML to be processed and applied against Kubernetes. This
YAML object is then tracked and handles creation, updates and deleted
seamlessly - including drift detection!

A set of helpful data resources to process directories of YAML files
and inline templating is available.
