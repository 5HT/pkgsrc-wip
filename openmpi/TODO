- Update API/ABI depends in buildlink3.mk; seems like it can't be right.

- Explain if this is to update openmpi, or to be openmpi4.  I assume
  the former, given the wip name.

- Explain if fortran is an option or not.  USE_LANGUAGES has fortran
  (which 1.10.7 didn't), but there's still an f90 option.  Perhaps the
  base openmpi always needs fortran to build, but one only can use it
  with fortran if the option is on?

- Explain if the subprefix scheme depend on other MPI impls adopting
  it.  Or is it just that one can install one non-prefixed, or N
  prefixed, or at most one non-prefixed?
