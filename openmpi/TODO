This is a candidate to replace the contents of parallel/openmpi.

- Update API/ABI depends in buildlink3.mk; seems like it can't be right.

- f90 is a default-on option, which seems right.  However fortran is
  unconditionally in USE_LANGUAGES.  Either make it condition or
  explain why.

- Explain if the subprefix scheme depend on other MPI impls adopting
  it.  Or is it just that one can install one non-prefixed, or N
  prefixed, or at most one non-prefixed?

- PLIST errors, especially PLIST.ignoretkr related
