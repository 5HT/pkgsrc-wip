This is a candidate to replace the contents of parallel/openmpi.

- f90 is a default-on option, which seems right.  However fortran was
  unconditionally in USE_LANGUAGES.  Test build with f90 off.

- If not, explain if the subprefix scheme depend on other MPI impls
  adopting it.  Or is it just that one can install one non-prefixed,
  or N prefixed, or at most one non-prefixed?

- PLIST errors, especially PLIST.ignoretkr related.

- There are two files in etc which should be moved and be CONF_FILES.
