# KSH93

This repository contains the AT&T Software Technology (AST) toolkit
from AT&T Research.  As of November 2017 the development focus has
been shifted to the `ksh` (or `ksh93`) command and supporting code required
to build it.

The non-ksh code of the AST project is no longer being actively
maintained. If you are interested in the non-ksh code see below for
details on which branches contain the full AST code base.

The project only supports systems where the compiler and underlying
hardware is ASCII compatible. This includes Linux on IBM zSeries but not
z/OS. The nascent, incomplete, support for EBCDIC has been removed. See
[issue #742](https://github.com/att/ast/issues/742).
