The systemd check in zmpkg.pl does not work, even on systems that use systemd.
It fails to start, eventually timing out, if there is any parent process
between zmpkg.pl and systemd or init - such as /etc/init.d/zoneminder

But everything does seem to work ok from systemd without this roundabout code
anyway, so just inhibit it.
