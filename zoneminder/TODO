Get rid of MESSAGE in favor of installed documentation if needed, or
just delete if it's duplicative with upstream docs.

for (some subset of final point releases):

  update to newer upstream, which requires cmake

  validate that it actually runs

  push to pkgsrc

Investigate mysql and php compat requirements.  It seems modern php
might somehow include mysql bindings and thus we don't need to require
5.6.
