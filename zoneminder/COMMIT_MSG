    Scalability improvements

Upstream upgrade notes:

    The upgrade scripts will take longer than normal to run,
    especially if you have many events

    Your previous settings on the Options -> Paths tab have been moved
    into the file zmcustom.conf which is typically found under
    /etc/zm/conf.d

    Consider migrating your events folder from the former bind mount
    method to the new method under Options -> Storage

    You should no longer have symbolic links in your webroot
    folder. This resolves a long standing security issue.

    The Apache config file has changed. This config file may or may
    not update automatically. This depends on what distro you are
    running and how you installed ZoneMinder. Please refer to the
    documentation for your distro to learn what specific steps are
    required.
