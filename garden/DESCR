Garden grows and cultivates collections of Git trees.

Garden helps you define development workflows that operate over collections of
self-contained and interdependent Git worktrees.

Features

variables, configuring search paths, and creating arbitrary groupings of
repositories for development.
 - Bootstrap Git-based development environments from source.
 - Define arbitrary collections of Git repositories for running commands.
 - Define environment variables scoped to specific projects or trees.
 - Define custom commands and workflows in a simple declarative config file.
 - Develop, build and test interdependent projects in self-contained sandboxes.
