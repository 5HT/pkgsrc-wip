- Probably more dependencies are needed (despite it seems it run fine):
   lua-busted
 (According: <https://packages.debian.org/sid/source/neovim>, via:
  <https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Building-Neovim#build-prerequisites>)
  - lua-busted should only be needed for tests
- Some modifications to devel/lua-luv are needed for neovim to compile
  (namely, a buildlink3.mk and -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON in CMAKE_ARGS)
