Builds fine, but when I try to start it I see:

thread 'main' panicked at 'Failed to create ZBus session connection.: Io(Os { code 2, Kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" })', src/globals.rs:12:14

I ktraced it and see that this error message after the program tries to access "/run/user/1000/bus".
