cross/avrdude: Update to 7.0

Changes in version 7.0:

  * Major changes compared to the previous version:

    - Completely revamped Windows support, including MSVC
    - Started to add CMake (by now, parallel with autoconf/automake)
    - New-architecture devices (AVR8X mega and tiny) can access all
      fuses, and memory display shows meaningful alias names
    - The "safemode" feature has been removed. The major class of
      programmers it has been designed for (lowlevel bitbang
      programmers on parallel or serial ports) virtually doesn't exist
      anymore, and the fuse combination that was covered by it do not
      match the fuses of modern AVR devices anyway.
    - avrdude.conf is now being looked up in the location of the
      executable file first, before considering the configured default
      location; this eases a "portable use" where the entire suite is
      not installed into its configured default location. (Basically
      only relevant for unixoid systems; on Windows, this search order
      has been used for many years already.)
