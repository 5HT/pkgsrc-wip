dither is a library for dithering images in Go. It has many dithering
algorithms built-in, and allows you to specify your own. Correctness is a
top priority, as well as performance. It is designed to work well on its
own, but also implements interfaces from the standard library, so that it
can be integrated easily in a wide variety of situtations. It supports
images that make use of the alpha channel, AKA transparency.
