sysutils/sformat: Update to 3.7

Switch to schilytools release.


AN-2021-09-01:
- sformat: Added support for gettext() based translations
  The string "Jörg Schilling" is now separate and in a gettext() call.


AN-2021-07-29:
- sformat: changed open(..., 0) -> open(..., O_RDONLY) for z/OS

  Thanks to a report from Matthew R. Wilson

- sformat:checkmount.c: did use HAVE_SYS_MNTENT_H instead of
  HAVE_SYS_MNTTAB_H as a result of a typo that was introduced with
  the code to #include <sys/mnttab.h>.

  Thanks to a report from Matthew R. Wilson


AN-2018-10-30:
- libschily: ovstrcpy() from various programs has been moved to libschily.
  This affects smake, mkisofs, patch, ved, count, sformat


AN-2018-05-25:
- sformat: The man page used .cs that dos not work with GNU troff because
  of a GNU troff bug. We no longer use this command for nroff. Note that
  the GNU troff bug still applies if you try to print the man page.

- sformat: History and Download sections have been added to the man page


AN-2018-03-01:
- sformat: A new option -randv has been added. This option behaves
  similar to -randrw but does not write to the disk and thus is less
  harmful to already impaired disks.

- sformat: The random tests now use drand48(). This is needed in order
  to get a sufficient coverage for modern large disks.


AN-2017-09-25:
- Sformat: The terminating condition for a manual sector size
  question for Adaptec controllers has been corrected.


AN-2016-01-25:
- sformat: A new option scgopts=list has been introduced.


AN-2015-11-26:
- sformat: diskfmt.c now casts a computation to always result in a long long
  printf() argument.


AN-2015-11-21:
- sformat: fixed a printf() format size problem on Minix3 32 bits.
  Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting.


AN-2013-05-10
- Include file reordering in sformat to avoid warnings on older platforms


AN-2011-08-29:
- sformat(1) now compiles and works on Win-DOS using the Microsoft compiler.


AN-2011-08-10:
- sformat now only sets up signal handlers for existing signals to support MSC


AN-2009-12-29:
- [...]
  sformat/datio.c:
  [...]
  Do no longer shorten strings using strcpy()/wcscpy() as newer POSIX
  versions claim that overlapping buffers cause undefined.
  results and as the Solaris 64 bit libc starting with Build 125,.
  implements strcpy() using SSE instructions and thus fails with
  overlapping strings.
