Dlib is a modern C++ toolkit containing machine learning algorithms and tools
for creating complex software in C++ to solve real world problems. It is used
in both industry and academia in a wide range of domains including robotics,
embedded devices, mobile phones, and large high performance computing
environments.

There is also wip/dlib, with older version, different master site and fewer
headers in the PLIST. To be checked with the maintainer.
