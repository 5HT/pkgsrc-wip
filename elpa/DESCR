Eigenvalue SoLvers for Petaflop-Applications (ELPA)

The computation of selected or all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric
(Hermitian) matrix has high relevance for various scientific disciplines.
For the calculation of a significant part of the eigensystem typically direct
eigensolvers are used. For large problems, the eigensystem calculations with
existing solvers can become the computational bottleneck.

As a consequence, the *ELPA* project was initiated with the aim to develop and
implement an efficient eigenvalue solver for petaflop applications, supported
by the German Federal Government, through BMBF Grant 01IH08007, from
Dec 2008 to Nov 2011.
