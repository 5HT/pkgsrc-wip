Carburetta is an open source fused scanner parser generator for the C and C++
languages. Fused means it can generate both the scanner and the parser from
the same input which simplifies parsing languages. This is beneficial for the
following reasons:

* You won't have to manually ferry data and types back and forth between the
  scanner and the parser.
* The nuances of the scanner are available to the parser. If the type of a
  "[0-9]+" patterned token is "int" then that is also the type the token appears
  as in the parser's grammar. No longer a need to shovel everything into a
  single "token" data type only to "unshovel" it later.
