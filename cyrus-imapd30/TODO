Warning: this pkg is currently under construction. It was created as a
copy of mail/cyrus-imap24. It cannot currently be expected that it can
be built, let alone that it will work as expected. I plan to keep the
pkg up to date here so that the progress is transparent. I am open to
suggestions or active support.

Done:

- Make it build the most basic way

- Make it install

- Update PLIST (take care of ldap / http options)

- Evaluation of the patches of the existing Cyrus-imap-pkgs and
  their applicability for cyrus-imap 3

- Review and adjustment of scripts / provided files (configuration
  examples, man pages)

- Performed first integration tests (client connection to IMAP,
  authenticated via saslauthd with ldap)

- Integrated documentation from source package into the package

- Possibly create further patches for cyrus-imap 3 (especially with
  regard to the newly added functions CalDAV / CardDAV), if necessary

Next steps:

- regenerate documentation at build time using Sphinx

Bugs:

- The way how the Dav-Patch is integrated. It is not a security patch
  nor a patch that would be necessary to ensure the build.
  In principle, it eliminates a functional deficiency, which may
  not be a deficiency at all, but simply an implementation gap.
  pkgsrc is therefore not the right place to deal with this problem,
  I'm almost sure of that. Without this patch, the CalDAV / CardDAV
  functionality cannot be used meaningfully for me, and in my
  experience it will also be for most other users who want to
  maintain a shared calendar, for example. I will definitely keep
  an eye on what is going on upstream. In the meantime, I would like
  to keep the patch here if there are no important reasons why.

- Kerberos support, PostgreSQL and MySQL are currently not tested
