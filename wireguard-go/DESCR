This is an implementation of WireGuard in Go.

Most Linux kernel WireGuard users are used to adding an interface with `ip link
add wg0 type wireguard`. With wireguard-go, instead simply run:

$ wireguard-go wg0

This will create an interface and fork into the background. To remove the
interface, use the usual `ip link del wg0`, or if your system does not support
removing interfaces directly, you may instead remove the control socket via `rm
-f /var/run/wireguard/wg0.sock`, which will result in wireguard-go shutting
down.

To run wireguard-go without forking to the background, pass `-f` or
`--foreground`:

$ wireguard-go -f wg0
