InitWare isn't ready to use yet!! Unless you are doing so for fun, to
experiment, or to contribute, you most likely do not want to try to install
InitWare until a first stable release is made!

The InitWare Suite of Middleware allows you to manage services and system
resources as logical entities called units. Units are automatically scheduled by
the InitWare manager according to their dependency specifications. A user
session manager facilitates tracking of users' login sessions, with each user
getting their own dedicated service manager. Finally the Event Log System
provides a system-wide Event Log of events from various sources.

This package provides InitWare as an auxiliary service manager running under the
NetBSD rc.d framework. It does not replace init(8) or rc(8) by default. Logind
is non-functional for now.
