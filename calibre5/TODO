During make build:

>> SIPing 3 files...

>> Traceback (most recent call last):

We don't seem to have a package with sipbuild in it.
It may be that x11/py-sip needs to be updated from sip-4.19.25 to sip-5.5.0.tar.gz.
However its Makefile.common has the ominous comment
# Before updating, please check that any new version works with qgis.
# Apparently, there are problems with 5 and 6 with qgis 3.16 as of
# 2021-11.

https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/sip/download doesn't have a distfile
for sip 5 and 6 but refers to PyPI.

According to near code in setup/build.py we would need py-toml (toml-0.10.1.tar.gz)
