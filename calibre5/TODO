During make build:

>> SIPing 3 files...
>> /usr/pkg/bin/python3.9 -c from sipbuild.tools.build import main; main(); --verbose --no-make --qmake /usr/pkg/qt5/bin/qmake
>> Querying qmake about your Qt installation...
>> /usr/pkg/qt5/bin/qmake -query
>> These bindings will be built: pictureflow.
>> Generating the pictureflow bindings...
>> -c: Unable to find file "QtWidgets/QtWidgetsmod.sip"

We do have that file, in /usr/pkg/share/sip3.9/PyQt5/QtWidgets/QtWidgetsmod.sip.
This setting likely needs to be adjusted to the new way of sipping/building:
MAKE_ENV+=		SIP_DIR=${BUILDLINK_PREFIX.py-sip}/share/sip${PYVERSSUFFIX}

    (the message comes from sip-6.5.0/code_generator/metasrc/lexer.l; adding a directory to includeDirList somehow might help. The value may come from a call to set_globals. That is called in /sipbuild/builder.py with sip_include_dirs.

    Project() has an option called sip_include_dirs.

    Maybe baking the path into sip6 or pyqtbuild is the thing to do.

Next error:

>> SIPing 3 files...
>> /usr/pkg/bin/python3.9 -c from sipbuild.tools.build import main; main(); --verbose --no-make --qmake /usr/pkg/qt5/bin/qmake
>> Querying qmake about your Qt installation...
>> /usr/pkg/qt5/bin/qmake -query
>> These bindings will be built: pictureflow.
>> Generating the pictureflow bindings...
>> -c: Q_PID is undefined


According to near code in setup/build.py we would need py-toml (toml-0.10.1.tar.gz)
