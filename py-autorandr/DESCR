Autorandr is an automatic display configuration manager.
It allows us to automatically select a display configuration
based on connected devices.  This is a compatible Python rewrite
of wertarbyte/autorandr.  The original wertarbyte/autorandr tree is
unmaintained, with lots of open pull requests and issues. I forked it
and merged what I thought were the most important changes. If you are
searching for that version, see the legacy branch. Note that the Python
version is better suited for non-standard configurations, like if you
use --transform or --reflect. If you use auto-disper, you have to use
the bash version, as there is no disper support in the Python version
(yet). Both versions use a compatible configuration file format, so you
can, to some extent, switch between them.
