The Azure Identity library provides Azure Active Directory (AAD)
token authentication through a set of convenient TokenCredential
implementations. It enables Azure SDK clients to authenticate with
AAD, while also allowing other Python apps to authenticate with
AAD work and school accounts, Microsoft personal accounts (MSA),
and other Identity providers like AAD B2C service.
