  * Updated UPnP router configuration support (now using miniupnp)
  * Add an FOV override slider and warning
  * macOS and Windows: added a checkbox for native file dialogs

    them, so this will give users more flexibility. Links to the old textures and a guide to hi-res textures will be provided soon;
    in the meantime the data files with hi-res plugins can be found in the 1.4 release.

Aleph One 1.4
=============

Note: This release is not network compatible with Aleph One 1.3 and earlier.

Changes:

  * Adds support for Lua ephemera: optional scripted effects like precipitation or gore, that can be turned on and off without
    affecting saved games, films, and net games
  * Adds a new "Editor" mode that integrates better with Weland for seamless visual mode editing
  * Adds new high frame rate interpolation. Choose 30 fps for authentic classic play, 60 fps or 120 fps capped, or unlimited fps

  * Adds support for weapon hot keys. Hot keys 1-9 switch weapons, but can be overridden by Lua scripts; hot keys 10-12 are
    reserved for Lua scripts
  * Restores some retro/nostalgia features in the software renderer: every-other-line mode, and 8-bit color
  * MML/Lua can now set the maximum inventory on a per-difficulty level. This should add versatility for balancing difficulty in
    new scenarios

Aleph One 1.3a1
===============

This is a pre-release to allow community members to assist in testing some internal code changes. Please see the Pfhorums thread if
you would like to help.

The latest stable release is: Aleph One 1.2.1

Aleph One 1.2.1
===============

The 1.2.1 release fixes a crashing bug when carnage message MML is used. Otherwise it is identical to the 1.2 release.

Aleph One 1.2
=============

The Aleph One 1.2 release features online leaderboards and game statistics, a streamlined saved-game system, and full multiplayer
support for the original Marathon game. This release also includes a number of other new features and bug fixes.

If you do not use the bundled downloads, we recommend that you update your scenario files. Each game includes a new plugin for the
online leaderboards, and the Marathon scenario includes an important compatibility fix.

Aleph One 1.2 is not network compatible with the previous stable release.

Online features

Aleph One now integrates with the online leaderboards and player stats at lhowon.org. Sign up within Aleph One to send your
Marathon, Marathon 2, and Marathon Infinity game results to lhowon.org, where you can see your overall win percentage, kill totals,
and more.

From the new "Internet" preferences section, you can register your chat name, opt in to player stats, and configure other options
relating to online play.

Saved games

Saving your game no longer stops the action until you type in a name. Each time you use a pattern buffer, a new saved game is
created. The "Continue Saved Game" dialog shows you the in-game location, date, and game time for every save. Use the "Load Other"
button to open a saved game from an earlier version of Aleph One.

Marathon compatibility

  * Cooperative play is now supported in the original Marathon scenario
  * Net games no longer use incorrect physics models
  * Goal checking in repair levels now matches the original game
  * Grenade trajectory in low-gravity levels now matches the original game
  * Certain terminals and rechargers could be activated when they shouldn't have been. You must use the 1.2 scenario data files to
    get this update.
  * If you have an existing saved game on an "exploration" level, you may need to re-explore the level before you can exit. We
    apologize for the inconvenience.

Lua

  * Additions to the Lua API:
      - Triggers.projectile_created()
      - Game.dead_players_drop_items
      - Level.index
      - Level.map_checksum
      - Line.visible_on_automap
      - Polygon.visible_on_automap
  * Additions to the Lua HUD API:
      - Level.name
      - Level.index
      - Level.map_checksum
  * Custom fields on projectiles, monsters, etc. are cleared when the object is destroyed
  * Lua error messages contain more diagnostic info
  * Player:find_action_key_target() no longer triggers side effects

Other changes

  * New preferences:
      - Camera Bobbing (Graphics) — if disabled, the camera and weapon will remain steady, to reduce motion sickness
      - Join Pregame Lobby by Default (Internet -> Pregame Lobby) — if checked, when you choose "Join Network Game", Aleph One
        automatically presses "Find Internet Game" on the next screen. Hold down the Alt (Option) key to join a local game.
      - Use Netscript in Films, Netscript File (Environment) — use these preferences to play back films of games recorded with
        netscripts. Solo Lua scripts are no longer loaded during playback of net game films.
  * Logging in to the pregame lobby uses HTTPS to protect your password
  * The editing cursor in text fields can be moved with the arrow keys or the mouse
  * Command history in the Lua/chat console can be accessed with the up and down arrow keys
  * Team color selection in the Join dialog is disabled when the game does not support teams
  * Plugin API changes:
      - Scenario compatibility, to create plugins that load only for specific scenarios
      - More combinations of items are allowed within a single plugin
  * The Plugins dialog (Preferences > Environment > Plugins) lists the components of each plugin
  * Lua HUD support is available by plugin only
  * A custom port can be used when gathering net games. The port number can only be changed by editing the XML preferences file.

Crashes fixed

  * Maps with invalid light indexes in OpenGL (Shader) renderer
  * 3D models lacking texture coordinates
  * #STATIC command in terminals (SF #580)
  * Joining a net game after a "map not found" film playback error (SF #504)

  * Motion sensor on magnetic levels works properly when frame rate lags (SF #372)
  * Styled chat names display properly in pregame lobby game info dialog

Platform-specific fixes

  * Linux:
      - A new configure script now succeeds when optional dependencies are missing. The script also summarizes which features are
        enabled. Packagers should review the configure options, which have changed.
      - Aleph One builds and runs with more versions of FFmpeg / libav (SF #576, #578, #582)
      - Web links no longer cause Aleph One to become unresponsive on some systems

  * Popping is reduced in certain ambient sounds
  * Various MML settings are correctly reset when changing levels
  * Some common but unhelpful messages are no longer written to the log file
