wget2 is a fresh and maintainable codebase with features like
multithreaded downloads, HTTP2, OCSP, HSTS, Metalink, IDNA2008,
Public Suffix List, Multi-Proxies, Sitemaps, Atom/RSS Feeds,
compression (gzip, deflate, lzma, bzip2), support for local filenames,
etc.  Some of these feature have been built into wget in the
meantime, but some other are really hard to implement into the old
codebase.
