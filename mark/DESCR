Mark is a tool for syncing your markdown documentation with Atlassian
Confluence pages.

This is very useful if you store documentation to your software in a
Git repository and don't want to do an extra job of updating Confluence
page using a tinymce wysiwyg enterprise core editor which always breaks
everything.

Mark does the same but in a different way. Mark reads your markdown
file, creates a Confluence page if it's not found by its name, uploads
attachments, translates Markdown into HTML and updates the contents of
the page via REST API. It's like you don't even need to create
sections/pages in your Confluence anymore, just use them in your
Markdown documentation.

Mark uses an extended file format, which, still being valid markdown,
contains several HTML-ish metadata headers, which can be used to locate
page inside Confluence instance and update it accordingly.
