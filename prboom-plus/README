SDL1 based branch formerly maintained by e6y.

If you see crashes only with certain maps and only on big endian machines
like PowerPC or SPARC, try this patched version.

This package fixes the following bug in prboom+ 2.5.1.4:
Loading maps using extended nodes crashes on big endian machines
(because 32-bit values are imported with wrong byte order).

Bug was reported and is already fixed upstream.

=========

If you see crashes in multiplayer games, try this patched version.

This package contains fixes for CVE-2019-20797 backported from 2.5.1.5.

=========

games/prboom-plus now tracks the SDL2 based UMAPINFO branch.
This package will stay in wip for machines that are slow with SDL2.
