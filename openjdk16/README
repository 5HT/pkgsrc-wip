This package does not work yet, because the jmod version of the tool
it builds segfaults frequently.

Traditionally pkgsrc does not allow $ORIGIN and that leads to very
invasive changes to the jdk. The build system used LD_LIBRARY_PATH
to be able to execute properly the bootstrap binaries. This interferes
with the build because the build needs to be able to run binaries it
just built and with LD_LIBRARY_PATH it will be using the bootstrap
ones and fail. This is also the reason we can't bootstrap from the
linux jdk and we need to bootstrap from NetBSD that has the same
version.

This build uses the linux jdk to bootstrap, and to be able to do
this in will use $ORIGIN. In my opinion $ORIGIN is a lesser evil
that $LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Here are the instructions to build:

Cwrappers filters out $ORIGIN, so the first step is to apply
cwrappers.diff in this directory and re-install cwrappers. This
will allow link lines that contain $ORIGIN.

Next install openjdk-bin. This is the latest openjdk-16 running
under linux emulation. Make sure it works.

Then run make extract. This will extract the openjdk and bootstrap.
cd $WORKDIR and
	mv bootstrap{,.old}
	ln -s /usr/local/java/openjdk-bin bootstrap

then
export MAKE_JOBS=<something> to make the build go faster.

Then make

If the build stalls because one of the openjdk-bin binaries SEGV'd
kill the build and restart it.
