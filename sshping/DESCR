# sshping
measure character-echo latency and bandwidth for an ssh session

## Description

Use this utility to test the performance of interactive ssh sessions
or scp file transfers.  It uses ssh to log into a remote system, then
runs two tests: the first test sends one character at a time, waiting
for each character to be returned while it records the latency time
for each.  The second test sends a dummy file over scp to /dev/null
on the remote system.

For the echo test, you may specify a character count limit (-c) or a test
time limit (-t), and also the command (-e) used on the remote system that
echoes characters back.

For the speed test, you may specify the number of megabytes to send (-s)
and the target location for the copies (-z).
