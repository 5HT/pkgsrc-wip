Entity Component Systems (ECS) are a form of decomposition that
completely decouples entity logic and data from the entity "objects"
themselves.

EntityX is an EC system that uses C++11 features to provide type-safe
component management, event delivery, etc. It was built during the
creation of a 2D space shooter.
