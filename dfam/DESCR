The Dfam database is a open collection of Transposable Element DNA
sequence alignments, hidden Markov Models (HMMs), consensus sequences,
and genome annotations.

Transposable elements (or interspersed repeats) account for a
substantial portion of eukaryotic genomes. Accurate annotation of TEs
enables research into their biology and can shed light on the
evolutionary processes that shape genomes. Dfam represents a
collection of multiple sequence alignments, each containing a set of
representative members of a specific transposable element
family. These alignments (seed alignments) are used to generate HMMs
and consensus sequences for each family. The Dfam website gives
information about each family, and provides genome annotations for a
collection of core genomes. The HMM models, and consensus sequences
may also be downloaded from the ftp site, for example to mask repeats
in new genomes.
