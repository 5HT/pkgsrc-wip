The rna-seq meta-package provides the core tools needed for performing
an RNA-Seq differential gene expression analysis, including adapter
trimming, quality control, alignment, and identification of
differentially expressed genes.  Researchers may want additional
tools for data manipulation, gene ontology, etc.

This package does not contain anything by itself -- it is a
"meta-package" that depends on other packages.  Its sole purpose is
to require dependencies so users can install this package only and
have all the other packages pulled in by the package dependency
mechanism.
